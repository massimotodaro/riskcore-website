# RISKCORE Website - Quick Start for Claude Code

## 🚀 Copy and paste this prompt to Claude Code to begin:

---

```
I need you to build the RISKCORE marketing website. Before we start, please:

1. Read the attached files carefully:
   - RISKCORE_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md (master instructions)
   - STATE_TEMPLATE.md (create as STATE.md)
   - ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md (create as ROADMAP.md)

2. Create the GitHub repository:
   - Name: riskcore-website
   - Owner: massimotodaro
   - Public repository
   - Initialize with README

3. Start with Phase 1, Task 1.1.

CRITICAL RULES:
- ALWAYS update STATE.md after completing tasks
- ALWAYS commit and push after each task
- ALWAYS read STATE.md after any memory reset
- NEVER use Tailwind v4 (use v3.4+)
- ALWAYS match the dark theme from Riskboard.html

The design reference file (Riskboard.html) shows the exact visual style to follow:
- Dark background (#0f172a)
- Glass morphism cards
- Green/blue accent colors
- Space Grotesk headings
- Inter body text

Start now with Task 1.1: Create GitHub repository.
```
